# BlinkWithoutDelay
## By: Lauren Marone

### Software Design
For this assignment, I coded a program that will have the RGB LED light (just the red color) on my board fade in and out continuously. The code is simple and consists of a setup and a loop function. The loop function is where the if statement happens that allows the light to fade in and out over and over again. I worked with the professor to incorporate millis() into the program so I do not have to use a delay. 


### Reflections
I feel like I have been behind in this class so a lot of things have been pretty hard for me to do and catch up on. This project was no different as I was not able to complete it without the help of our professor. I hope that before the third part of this class, I will be able to do more things on my own as I am worried it will effect my ability to complete the final two projects. Besides that, after listening to our professor explain not using delays and doing it with him, I understand why and how we try not to use delays and I believe I might be able to implement it in another program if I wanted!
